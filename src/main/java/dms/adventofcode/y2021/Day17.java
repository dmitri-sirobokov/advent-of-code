/**
 * Day 17: Trick Shot
 * Chain of thoughts...My feeling is there are better ways to calculate the highest point of the trajectory, possibly with one arithmetic equations, but
 * I start with the simple math calculation, that is based on...
 * The series of numbers 0,1,2,..n has a sum of n * (n + 1) / 2
 * This is like a travel distance for an object that starts with 0 speed with acceleration of 1.
 * For horizontal speed the best starting point where drone is at 0 x-speed withing target area and then increasing towards starting point..
 * For the vertical motions we have to look at highest position where speed is zero, and then increasing towards starting point or towards target area. */
